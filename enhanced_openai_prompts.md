## Special Instructions

1. **Avoid Generic Descriptions**: Instead of "thoughtful" or "funny," be specific about HOW they're thoughtful or what KIND of humor they use.

2. **Use Actual Examples**: Reference specific quotes, reactions, or moments from the transcript when possible.

3. **Capture the Unfiltered Reality**: This is friends talking casually - include the messy, real aspects of how people actually communicate.

4. **Identify the Missing 6th Person**: If there are moments where someone is being addressed or referenced who isn't on a mic, note this as the "unmiced participant."

5. **Flag Soundboard Content**: If there are audio clips that seem artificial or repeated (soundboard), mark these clearly as non-human content.

6. **Dynamic Speaker Count**: Don't assume exactly 5 speakers - let the content reveal how many people are actually participating.

Remember: You're creating a snapshot of real friendship dynamics around a shared love of film. Capture both the intellectual discussion and the natural, unguarded moments that make these people who they are.
