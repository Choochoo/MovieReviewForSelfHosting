2. **Use .NET User Secrets for development (optional):**
   ```bash
   dotnet user-secrets init
   dotnet user-secrets set "TMDB:ApiKey" "your-tmdb-key"
   dotnet user-secrets set "Gladia:ApiKey" "your-gladia-key"
   ```

3. **Or use the secure first-run setup (recommended):**
   ```bash
   dotnet run --instance "dev"
   # Follow the setup wizard at http://localhost:5000/setup
   ```

### Building

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

## üöÄ Deployment

For production deployment:

1. Set up your MongoDB instance
2. Configure environment variables for MongoDB connections
3. Run the application - it will guide you through secure setup
4. Optional: Set up reverse proxy (nginx/Apache) for HTTPS

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- **Regenerate any exposed keys** immediately
- **Keep your secrets.json file secure** and backed up
- **Respect API rate limits** for all integrated services

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### First Run Issues
- Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible
- Check that all required environment variables are set
- Verify API keys are valid and active

### Missing Configuration
- Delete the instance folder `%APPDATA%/MovieReviewApp/instances/{instance-name}/` to reset setup
- Or delete just the `secrets.json` file for that instance
- Restart the application to trigger first-run setup again

### API Issues
- Verify your API keys are active and have sufficient credits
- Check API rate limits if requests are failing
- Ensure network connectivity to external APIs
