# Build Artifacts Cleanup Report

## Overview
Performed comprehensive cleanup of build artifacts and temporary files in the MovieReviewApp repository to reduce repository size and ensure proper version control hygiene.

## Space Reclaimed
- **Build directories cleaned**: Approximately **1.8GB** of build artifacts removed
  - `MovieReviewApp/bin/`: 20MB removed
  - `MovieReviewApp/obj/`: 1.8GB removed (largest contributor)
  - `MovieReviewApp.Tests/bin/`: 14MB removed
  - `MovieReviewApp.Tests/obj/`: 296KB removed
- **Log files**: 55KB (app.log removed)
- **Total estimated space saved**: **~1.85GB**

## Files and Directories Cleaned
1. **Build Artifacts**:
   - Removed all `bin/Debug/` directories and contents
   - Removed all `obj/Debug/` directories and contents
   - Removed NuGet cache files (`.cache`, `project.assets.json`, etc.)
   - Removed compiler-generated files (`.dll`, `.pdb`, `.exe` files)

2. **Log Files**:
   - Removed `app.log` (55KB application log file)

3. **Visual Studio Cache**:
   - Attempted to remove `.vs/` directory (12MB) but encountered permission issues due to locked files
   - This directory is already properly excluded in `.gitignore`

## Files NOT Cleaned (Intentionally Preserved)
- **User uploads**: `MovieReviewApp/wwwroot/uploads/` (2.9GB) - Contains user-uploaded audio files and media
- **Static assets**: CSS, JS, Bootstrap files, favicon, etc.
- **Source code**: All application source code preserved
- **Configuration files**: Settings and project files maintained

## .gitignore Improvements
Enhanced the `.gitignore` file with additional entries to prevent future commits of temporary files:

```gitignore
# Application logs
app.log
*.log

# Temporary directories
temp/
tmp/
```

## Recommendations for Repository Hygiene

### 1. Regular Cleanup Commands
Add these commands to your development workflow:
```bash
# Clean build artifacts
dotnet clean

# Remove all bin and obj directories manually (if needed)
find . -name "bin" -type d -exec rm -rf {} +
find . -name "obj" -type d -exec rm -rf {} +
```

### 2. Pre-commit Hook (Optional)
Consider adding a git pre-commit hook to automatically run `dotnet clean` before commits:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
dotnet clean --nologo --verbosity quiet
```

### 3. IDE Configuration
Configure your IDE to:
- Exclude `bin/` and `obj/` directories from search results
- Set up automatic cleanup on build
- Configure to not track build artifacts

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline
Ensure your build pipelines start with a clean state:
```yaml
- run: dotnet clean
- run: dotnet restore
- run: dotnet build
```

### 5. Development Environment
For WSL/Linux development environments:
- The `.vs/` directory may remain due to file locking from Windows Visual Studio
- This is normal and the directory is properly excluded from version control
- Close Visual Studio on Windows before cleaning if you need to remove `.vs/`

## Verification
After cleanup:
- All build artifacts successfully removed
- Repository size reduced by approximately 1.85GB
- `.gitignore` properly configured to prevent future artifact commits
- Project structure and source code integrity maintained
- All static assets and user data preserved

## Next Steps
1. **Test build**: Run `dotnet restore && dotnet build` to verify project builds correctly
2. **Commit changes**: The updated `.gitignore` should be committed to version control
3. **Team communication**: Share these cleanup procedures with other developers
4. **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor repository size and clean build artifacts as needed

The repository is now optimized for version control with proper exclusion of temporary files and build artifacts.
